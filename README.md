# titanic_classification
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and classification algorithms on Kaggle's titanic dataset. Project completed on a Jupyter Notebook using Python, pandas and sklearn. 

#### Project steps
- Cleaned the data by introducing dummy variables where necessary 
- Decided how to treat nulls and outliers
- Used Exploratory Data Analysis to investigate correlation and identify the best features to include in a model
- Used different classification algorithms to predict which people survived and calculated accuracy to choose the best model
- Experimented with different features and outlier treatment to compare accuracy
